## Abstract
Building and hosting a Knowledge Graph requires some effort and a lot of experience in semantic technologies. Turning this Knowledge Graph into a useful resource for problem solving requires even more effort. The overall goal of building a Knowledge Graph is to provide cost‐sensitive methods to host knowledge, improve its quality and ensuring the usefulness for envisaged applications: “There are two main goals of Knowledge Graph refinement: (a) adding missing knowledge to the graph, i.e., completion, and (b) identifying wrong information in the graph, i.e. error detection.” (Paulheim et al. 2017). This tutorial is targeting the process from knowledge creation over knowledge hosting, knowledge curation to knowledge deployment - applied to a Knowledge Graph using schema.org as an ontology.
